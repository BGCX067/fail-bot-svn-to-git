#summary What is ping spoofing?

== Introduction ==

Ping spoofing is making your ping on BNET appear different than it is.

FailBot supports all known methods of ping spoofing, including:
  * 0ms Ping Spoof
  * -1ms Ping Spoof
  * UPD Ping Spoof
  * Custom Ping Spoof

=== 0ms Ping Spoof ===
0ms spoof causes Battle.net to view your ping as 0ms

=== -1ms Ping Spoof ===
-1ms spoof causes Battle.net to view your ping as -1ms OR BELOW
(I have seen people get -3ms before)

=== UPD Ping Spoof ===
This makes BNET think that you do not support UPD Packets (required to play games)

=== Custom Ping Spoofing ===
This makes your Ping whatever you set it to, OR CLOSE TO IT.
This is done by storing all your pings from when you open the bot, averaging them together, and delaying sending the Ping Packet based on the average time.
You must connect ATLEAST once before the custom ping will be used.
